My admissible heuristic for h3 uses the Manhattan distance heuristic 
minus the cost of directly adjacent double squares to calculate moves.
In detail, if it is possible to move 2 squares in a direction, lets say
LEFT. If moving those two squares to the left ends them up in their goal 
positions, then we add 1 to our DBL_distance, as it would take 2 moves to
that state without double moves. Another way it calulates to get closer to the 
real number of moves is by checking if we move two squares, and then we 
move each of those squares independently UP or DOWN or both
(if we have just DBL_MOVE'd LEFT or RIGHT) or LEFT or RIGHT or both
(if we have just DBL_MOVE'd UP or DOWN), then we also add 1 to our DBL_distance,
as it would take 3 moves to get to that state instead of 4. Then, we take
the Manhattan distance and return the Manhattan Distance subtracted by our
DBL_distance to get our estimated cost. This works because when we calculate
our DBL_distance, we are adding the difference of moves it would take by
only using a single move by the difference of moves it would take by using
a double move. Subtracting this distance by the Manhattan distance of this
state will remove single moves that can be more efficiently completed with
double moves. Since the Manhattan distance is already admissible for single moves,
subtracting the only inefficient moves when using doubl moves from this
distance will still create an admissible heuristic for double moves. Therefore
making this an admissible heuristic consider single moves and efficient double moves.
